# careerbot

This chatbot uses the Pandorabot environment and interacts with an undergraduate student who is nearing the 
completion of their degree plan. The student the bot interacts with may be starting to think about directing
their career path in a specific direction or may be preparing for an interview. 

As part of this assignment, I was asked to identify five job types that require an undergraduate degree in 
omputer science and construct a chatbot in the Pandorabot environment using Aritifial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML). 
The chatbot interacts with individual students, helping them identify their strengths and preferences, 
and helping them decide which career options to consider.
