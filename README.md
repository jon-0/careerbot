This chatbot uses the Pandorabot environment and interacts with an undergraduate student who is nearing the 
completion of their degree plan. The student the bot interacts with may be starting to think about directing
their career path in a specific direction or may be preparing for an interview. 

As part of this assignment, I was asked to identify five job types that require an undergraduate degree in computer science and
construct a chatbot in the Pandorabot environment that will interact with individual students, help them
identify their strengths and preferences, and help them decide which career options to consider.
